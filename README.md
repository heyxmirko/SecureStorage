# SecureStorage
 SecureStorage is a simple and lightweight Spigot plugin that prevents players in survival mode from opening chests, shulker boxes, furnaces, hoppers, and other containers immediately after breaking a block. This feature helps prevent block glitching and enhances gameplay experience. 

 Players in creative mode can bypass this delay and open all types of containers instantly. SecureStorage is perfect for survival mode servers looking to prevent stealing of items, for example, from a chest in a claim, where after the player to whom the claim does not belong has a time window of a few milliseconds to open the chest behind a wall after destroying the wall block. The delay is set to `5 server ticks` which eaquals to `0.25 seconds`
